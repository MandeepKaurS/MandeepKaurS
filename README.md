- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Mandeep Kaur, an enthusiastic learner always eager to explore new technologies and programming languages. 
- Right now, I'm focusing on developing my skills in Python, React, and software testing, but my love of learning doesn't stop there. I have a passion for discovering new languages, both the ones that computers use and the ones that human beings speak and understand (like French). 
- In my free time, I enjoy reading, listening to podcasts, and connecting with others who share my love of learning. 
- If you're interested in chatting or connecting, feel free to reach out to me at maanoshergill@gmail.com.
